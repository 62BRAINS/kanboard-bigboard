kanboard-bigboard
=================

A Kanboard that can display multiple projects.

Go To Project-Management->BigBoard. Here you will see all projects you have access to in one page.

All functionality is still available, so you can drag-and-drop tasks, add tasks etc.

Comments Welcome.


## Important Notice

I am no longer using Kanboard, therefore i will no longer maintain or support the Bigboard. I twould be great if someone is interested in volunteering to maintain the project in the future.
