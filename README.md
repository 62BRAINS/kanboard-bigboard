kanboard-bigboard
=================

A Kanboard that can display multiple projects.

It depends on changes to Kanboard, which are available in PR #2474.

Go To Project-Management->BigBoard. Here you will see all projects you have access to in one page.

All functionality is still available, so you can drag-and-drop tasks, add tasks etc.

Comments Welcome.
